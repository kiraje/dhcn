        <p><strong>1. Copyrights Complaints</strong></p>
    
        <p>Following the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ("DMCA") and other applicable law,
            OnlineToolsApp has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances, and in
            OnlineToolsApp' sole discretion, users who are repeat infringers. OnlineToolsApp may also,
            in our sole discretion, limit access to the Services if you infringe any intellectual property
            rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.</p>
    
        <p><strong>2. DMCA Notice </strong></p>
    
        <p>If you believe that anything on the Services infringes upon any copyright which you own or
            control, you may file a notification of such infringement with our Designated Agent as set forth
            below. </p>
    
        <p>Pursuant to 17 U.S.C. 512(c)(3), your notification may be IGNORED if it does not include at least

            <li>Provide us with a way to contact you, such as your address, telephone number, or email;</li>
            <li>Provide a statement that you believe in good faith that the item you have identified as
