        <p>This Privacy Policy explains what information <span class="domainName">Mutual Media</span> (referred to herein
            as
            "<span class="domainName">Mutual Media</span>", "Company", "we", “us”, or “our”)
            collects from individuals who visit <span class="domainName">Mutual Media</span> (the "Site"), download the
            Software (as defined below) and/or participate in the services offered by <span
                class="domainName">Mutual Media</span> as described herein ("User(s)" or "you"). Please take a moment to
            review this Privacy Policy, which explains how we use and maintain that information. If you do not
            agree to this Privacy Policy, you should not visit the Site, download the Software and/or
            participate in the resources offered by <span class="domainName">Mutual Media</span>.</p>
        <p><strong>Overview and Information Collected</strong></p>
        <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to information collected through the Site and Software.</p>
        <p>We collect two kinds of information. The first kind is information that can identify you as a
            specific individual - such as your name or email address (“Personally Identifiable
            Information” or "PII"). The second kind of information is non-personally identifiable
            information ("NPII"). Although this information is related to you, it is not associated with your
            PII and cannot be linked to you personally.</p>
        <p>“Content” includes information and instructions on how to convert your files and video
            media that are provided free of charge on the Site. You can download and install the <span
                class="domainName">Mutual Media</span> software or add-on/extension (collectively, the "Software") from
            other websites, including social media sites. The Software allows us to display text link, lightbox,
            new tab, pop-under, video and/or banner advertisements based on the web content you view. In
            addition, the Site, Content, and/or Software may display advertisements from third parties and/or
            contain links to other websites owned and operated by third parties. All third party applications
            and all advertisements from the Software, Site and accessible via Content shall collectively be
            known as “Third Party Content”.</p>
        <p>Third Party Content is used as a way to support <span class="domainName">Mutual Media</span>. Your dealings
            with
            Third Party Content, including, but not limited to, your interaction with its advertisements and
            promotions, your clicking on links provided by Third Party Content, purchase of its goods, or any
            other type of involvement, are solely between you and the third party. Therefore we do not endorse
            the advertisements, products or other materials of the Third Party Content. If you interact with the
            Third Party Content, their terms and conditions and privacy policies apply to your rights and
            obligations with respect to such interaction. Accordingly, such third parties may collect PII or
            NPII about you.</p>
        <p><strong>Collection of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)</strong></p>
        <p>PII is collected on the Site when you provide it to us via <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a>
            page, in which the Site asks for your name and email address so that you can receive a response to
            any questions you may have. The Software does not knowingly collect PII (see “Use and Sharing
            of Personally Identifiable Information” below).</p>
        <p>If you do not want us to collect your PII as described above or to use and share your PII as
            described further below in this Policy, you should NOT provide it to us through the Site feature
            described above. By providing us with your PII using this feature, you are authorizing our use and
            sharing of your PII as described in this Policy and any subsequent revisions to this Policy that we
            may publish on the Site.</p>
        <p><strong>Updating Your Personally Identifiable Information.</strong></p>
        <p>If your PII changes, or if you no longer desire our service, you may correct, update, amend, or
            remove it by emailing our Customer Support at support@<span class="domainName">mutualmedia.com</span> or by
            contacting us using our <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> page.</p>
        <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you
            services. In addition, we will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal
            obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
        <p><strong>Social Media (Features) and Widgets:</strong></p>
        <p>The Site may include Social Media Features, such as the Facebook Like button and Widgets, such as the
            Share this button or interactive mini-programs that run on the Site. These features may collect your
            IP address, which page you are visiting on the Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to
            function properly. Social Media Features and Widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted
            directly on the Site. Your interactions with these Social Media Features are governed by the privacy
            policy of the company providing it.</p>
        <p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p>
        <p>Our Site and Software are not directed to persons under 18. We do not knowingly collect PII from
            anyone under 18 years of age. If we become aware that a child under 18 has provided us with PII we
            will take steps to remove such information.</p>
        <p><strong>Use and Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information</strong></p>
        <p>We reserve the right to use PII: (1) for the specific purpose for which such information was provided
            as stated above; (2) for the purposes disclosed at the time such information is provided; and/or (3)
            as otherwise stated in this Policy. However, any PII that is unknowingly collected by the Software
            is not used in any way and our Software is continuously updated to identify, remove and prevent the
            capture of PII and other unnecessary data.</p>
        <p>We do not share, sell or trade any of your PII with any third parties other than described herein. We
            may share your PII with our principals, employees, consultants, officers, directors, members,
            agents, subsidiaries, or affiliates, or our parent company and its principals, parent company,
            employees, officers, consultants, directors, members, agents, subsidiaries, or affiliates
            (collectively “Related Companies”). Neither we nor our Related Companies contribute to
            or participate in cooperative databases, which give other companies access to your PII.</p>
        <p>We and our Related Companies may provide access to your PII when legally required to do so, to comply
            with a court order, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings, to protect
            against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site, Content, Software, to limit our legal liability and
            protect our rights or to protect the rights, property or safety of other users or the public.</p>
        <p>We and/or our Related Companies may also disclose your PII to outside companies and consultants that
            help bring you the services we offer. For example, we and our Related Companies may work with
            outside companies and consultants to: (a) manage a database of customer information; (b) assist with
            direct marketing and data collection; (c) provide data storage and analysis; (d) provide fraud
            prevention; (e) provide customer service by phone; and/or (f) provide other services designed to
            assist us in maximizing our business potential and maintaining our Site, Content and Software. We
            and our Related Companies require that these outside companies and consultants agree to keep
            confidential all information we share with them and use the information only to perform their
            obligations to us.</p>
        <p>In addition, if we go through a business transition, such as a merger, acquisition by another
            company, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, your PII will likely be among the assets
            transferred. You will be notified by a prominent notice on the <span class="domainName">Mutual Media</span>
            home
            page of any such change in ownership or control of your PII.</p>
        <p><strong>Non-Personally Identifiable Information (NPII)</strong></p>
        <p>As with many websites, when you visit the Site, it automatically gathers certain NPII based on your
            computer information and stores it in log files. This type of technical and statistical information
            is used to customize your experience at the Site, to help us improve the quality of the Site and to
            make your visits easy, convenient and fun. <span class="domainName">Mutual Media</span> also collects your IP
            address to help diagnose problems with the Site server and for Site administration purposes.</p>
        <p>In addition to the general collection of NPII by the Site (including, but not limited to, IP address,
            browser type, operating system version and time and date stamp, and landing page), the Software may
            collect your IP addresses, browser information, operating system information, URLs and the content
            of web pages you visit. We may use this NPII to assist us in delivering to you more relevant content
            in the form of Third Party Content, which appears when you are online generally. We may also work
            with third party advertising networks and advertisers who help deliver such Third Party Content to
            you. We may share your NPII and/or aggregated information with our third party partners to improve
            the relevancy of such Third Party Content and/or to provide other services designed to assist us in
            maximizing our business potential. These third party partners, including, but not limited to,
            advertising networks and advertisers, may also use cookies and other technologies to collect and
            track NPII such as demographic information, aggregated information, and Internet activity to assist
            them in delivering Third Party Content that is more relevant to your interests. They may also
            utilize supplemental data from other sources and analytics methods to help deliver more relevant
            Third Party Content. However, if at any time, you would like to permanently stop receiving all Third
            Party Content, you should uninstall the Software and stop using the Site (including to access
            Content). The directions for uninstalling the Softwareare set forth below in the section entitled
            "Removal."</p>
        <p>You can opt-out of the use of your NPII from being used by Network Advertising Initiative
            (“NAI”) members. The NAI opt-out tool was developed in conjunction with NAI members for
            the express purpose of allowing consumers to "opt-out" of the behavioral advertising delivered by
            NAI members. If you opt-out of the use of your NPII from being used by NAI members, you will
            continue to receive ads, however, it will prevent NAI members from delivering ads tailored to your
            preferences and usage patterns. If you opt-out of Interest-Based Advertising (as defined <a
                href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/understanding-online-advertising/what-is-it">here</a>)
            by one or more NAI member company, that choice will be stored in “opt-out cookies.” If
            you ever delete opt-out cookies from your browser (such as by clearing all cookies), buy a new
            computer, or change web browsers, you'll need to renew your opt-out choices. NAI member companies
            need to be able to read an "opt-out" cookie on your browser to know not to collect and use data for
            interest-based advertising purposes. For more information or to opt-out click <a
                href="https://www.networkadvertising.org/choices">http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a>.

        <p><strong>Cookies / Tracking Technologies</strong></p>
        <p>The Site and Software use "cookies" and similar means to collect aggregate Internet traffic
            statistics and to enhance your experience at the Site and with the Software. A cookie is a small
            text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies contain information that
            can later be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you. Cookies cannot be

        <p>In addition, third parties with whom we partner to provide certain features on our Site or to display
            advertising based upon your web browsing activity use LSOs such as HTML 5 and Flash to collect and
            store information. To learn how to manage privacy and storage settings for Flash cookies click <a href="https://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html#117118">here</a>

        <p><strong>Third Party Cookies</strong></p>
        <p>The use of cookies by our third party advertisers as well as third party ad servers is not covered by
            this Privacy Policy (as explained in the NPII section above). We do not have access or control over
            these cookies. These third parties may use session ID cookies to gather anonymous information.</p>
        <p><strong>Web Beacons</strong></p>
        <p>The Site may contain electronic images known as "web beacons" which are also sometimes called
            single-pixel gifs. Web beacons may be used to assist in delivering cookies, allow us to count Users
            who have visited the Site pages and to deliver services via the Site. If any partner advertises on
            the Site, we may work with them to place web beacons on their website to allow <span
                class="domainName">Mutual Media</span> to collect statistics on how often clicking on those
            advertisements
            on the Site results in a purchase or other action on such partner's website. <span
                class="domainName">Mutual Media</span> may also employ web beacons from third party partners in order to
            help compile aggregated statistics regarding the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns or other
            operations of the Site. <span class="domainName">Mutual Media</span> will never allow web beacons on the Site
            to
            be used by third parties (other than Related Companies) to collect or access your PII. We do not tie
            web beacons to any PII you submit while on our Site.</p>
        <p><strong>Use and Sharing of Non-Personally Identifiable Information (NPII)</strong></p>
        <p>We do not share, sell or trade any of your NPII with any third parties other than described herein.
            We may share your NPII with our Related Companies. Neither we nor our Related Companies contribute
            to or participate in cooperative databases, which give other companies access to your NPII.</p>
        <p>We and our Related Companies may provide access to your NPII to third parties when legally required
            to do so, to comply with a court order, to allow third party advertising networks to serve you more
            relevant ads as described above, to cooperate with police investigations or other legal proceedings,
            to protect against misuse or unauthorized use of the Site and/or to limit our legal liability and
            protect our rights.</p>
        <p>We and/or our Related Companies may also disclose your NPII to outside companies and consultants that
            help bring you the services we offer. For example, we and our Related Companies may work with
            outside companies and consultants to: (a) manage a database of customer information; (b) assist with
            direct marketing and data collection; (c) provide data storage and analysis; (d) provide fraud
            prevention; (e) provide customer service by phone; and/or (f) provide other services designed to
            assist us in maximizing our business potential and maintaining our Site, Content and Software. We

            confidential all information we share and use the information only to perform their obligations to

            page of any such change in ownership or control of your NPII.</p>
        <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
        <p>We have implemented technical, administrative and physical security measures to protect Information
            from unauthorized access and improper use. We keep information on servers that are protected by
            firewalls and located in a physically secure facility accessible only to our authorized employees
            and personnel of the Related Companies. From time to time, we review our security procedures in

            reasonable efforts, no security measures are impenetrable and any information transmitted to us or
