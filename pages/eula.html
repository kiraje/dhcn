            use of the Site (including ot access any Content). If you have downloaded the Software, you must
            immediately uninstall the Software. You may uninstall the Software by going to the <a
                href="https://onlineloginapp.com/pages/Uninstall.html">Uninstall</a> page and following the directions to remove the Software
            from your computer.</p>
        <p>5.2. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</span>. If you are
            aware of or believe there is any infringing content or other material on the Site, please notify us.
            We respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act

        <p>5.3 <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Dispute Resolution by Binding Arbitration</span>. Many
            user concerns can be resolved quickly and to the user's satisfaction by contacting us at the email
            address below or on the <a href="https://onlineloginapp.com/pages/Contact.html">Contact Us</a>page on the Site. If, however, there is
            an issue that needs to be resolved, this Section 5.3 describes how both of us will proceed.</p>
        <p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE YOU TO ARBITRATE DISPUTES WITH
            <span class="domainName">OnlineLoginApp.com</span> AND ITS RELATED COMPANIES AND LIMIT THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN
            SEEK RELIEF. Any claim or dispute between you and <span class="domainName">OnlineLoginApp.com</span> or its Related
            Companies arising out of or relating in any way to the Site (including Content), Software, these
            Terms and Conditions, marketing by <span class="domainName">OnlineLoginApp.com</span> or Third Party Content,
            including claims that arise after the termination of these Terms and Conditions, shall be resolved
            through final, binding arbitration. ARBITRATION PREVENTS YOU FROM SUING IN COURT OR FROM HAVING A
            JURY TRIAL. The obligation to arbitrate applies regardless of whether the claim or dispute involves
            a tort, fraud, breach of contract, misrepresentation, product liability, negligence, violation of a
            statute, or any other legal or equitable theory.
        </p>
        <p>We each agree that each of us may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and
            not in a class action or representative proceeding, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE DISPUTE IS HEARD IN
            ARBITRATION OR IN COURT. All arbitrations shall be conducted on an individual (and not a class-wide)
            basis and an arbitrator shall have no authority to award class-wide relief. You acknowledge and
            agree that these Terms and Conditions specifically prohibit you from commencing arbitration
            proceedings as a representative of others or joining in any arbitration proceedings brought by any
            other person.</p>
        <p>A party who intends to proceed with a claim or dispute must first send to the other a written Notice
            of Dispute (“Notice”) describing the nature and basis of the claim or dispute and
            setting forth the specific relief sought. All Notices to <span class="domainName">OnlineLoginApp.com</span> shall
            be
            sent via email to support@<span class="domainName">OnlineLoginApp.com</span>, <span
                class="domainName">OnlineLoginApp.com</span> will
            send notice to you via email to the email address we have on file for you, if any, or otherwise via
            a reasonable method. Upon receipt of such Notice, the other party shall have a thirty (30) day
            period in which it may satisfy the claim against it by fully curing the dispute and/or providing all
            the relief requested in the Notice. After the expiration of such thirty (30) day cure period, you or
            <span class="domainName">OnlineLoginApp.com</span> may commence an arbitration proceeding if the claim has not been
            fully satisfied.
        </p>
        <p>The arbitration of any claim or dispute under these Terms and Conditions shall be conducted by one
            arbitrator exclusively in Orange County, California, and state or federal courts located in Orange
            County, California shall have exclusive jurisdiction and venue over any appeals of or motions
            regarding an arbitration award. The arbitrator has the authority to grant any remedy that would be
            available in court, except that the arbitrator may not issue relief on behalf of a class or
            otherwise issue class-wide or group relief. You acknowledge and agree that each party shall pay the
            fees and costs of its own counsel, experts, witnesses, and filing fees and the parties shall split
            the cost of the arbitrator.</p>
        <p>If any aspect or portion of this Section 5.3 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that aspect or
            portion will be severed with the remainder of Section 5.3 remaining in full force and effect.</p>
        <p>YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT-OUT OF THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION WITHIN THIRTY (30) DAYS FROM THE DATE YOU
            FIRST USED THE SITE OR SOFTWARE BY SENDING AN EMAIL TO support@<span class="domainName">OnlineLoginApp.com</span>.
            FOR
            YOUR OPT-OUT TO BE EFFECTIVE, YOU MUST SEND A SIGNED WRITTEN NOTICE AND THE DATE YOU FIRST USED THE
            SITE OR SOFTWARE. UNTIMELY OPT-OUTS WILL NOT BE VALID AND YOU MUST THEN PURSUE YOUR CLAIM THROUGH
            ARBITRATION PURSUANT TO THESE TERMS.</p>
